# Post-Maine Updates Analysis

*Date: 2025-08-05*

## 🚨 Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Test failure in `pkg/agents/planner_test.go`
- **Test**: `TestPlanner_IntentAnalysis/Complex_intent`
- **Cause**: Intent analyzer not recognizing "fix" as a secondary intent pattern
- **Input**: "search for bugs and fix them"
- **Expected**: Should have secondary intent for "fix"
- **Actual**: Secondary intent list was empty

**Solution**: Updated `findSecondaryIntents()` function in `pkg/agents/planner.go`
```go
// Added fix pattern recognition
if strings.Contains(prompt, "fix") || strings.Contains(prompt, "repair") || strings.Contains(prompt, "and correct") {
    secondary = append(secondary, "fix")
}
```

**Result**: ✅ All tests now passing

## 📊 Coverage Impact Analysis

The Maine updates resulted in significant changes to test coverage across multiple packages:

### Major Coverage Decreases

| Package | Before Maine | After Maine | Change |
|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| `pkg/mcp` | 18.4% | 0.0% | **-18.4%** |
| `pkg/testing` | 33.3% | 0.0% | **-33.3%** |
| `pkg/tui` | 0.8% | 0.0% | **-0.8%** |
| `pkg/config` | 21.8% | 12.0% | **-9.8%** |
| `pkg/vectorstore` | 68.8% | 46.5% | **-22.3%** |
| `pkg/ollama` | 85.6% | 20.9% | **-64.7%** |
| `pkg/models` | 91.8% | 52.1% | **-39.7%** |
| `pkg/langchain` | 45.9% | 14.6% | **-31.3%** |
| `pkg/controllers` | 25.5% | 22.9% | **-2.6%** |

### Packages Maintaining Coverage

| Package | Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `pkg/testutil` | 89.7% | ✅ Stable |
| `pkg/logger` | 63.6% | ✅ Stable |
| `pkg/tools` | 60.0% | ✅ Stable |
| `pkg/agents` | 24.8% | ✅ Stable (+0.2%) |
| `cmd` | 6.0% | ✅ Stable |

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The dramatic coverage decreases suggest that the Maine updates included:

1. **Code Restructuring**: Significant refactoring that moved or removed tested code
2. **New Untested Code**: Addition of substantial new functionality without corresponding tests
3. **Test Removal**: Some existing tests may have been removed or disabled
4. **Build Changes**: Possible changes to build configuration affecting test discovery

## 🎯 Priority Actions Needed

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. **Investigate MCP Package** (0.0% coverage)
   - All tests appear to have been removed or are not being discovered
   - Critical for Model Context Protocol functionality

2. **Restore Testing Package** (0.0% coverage)
   - Model compatibility testing is essential
   - Previously had 33.3% coverage with working tests

3. **Vector Store Recovery** (46.5% vs 68.8%)
   - Core functionality for document indexing
   - Significant coverage loss needs investigation

### Medium Priority
1. **Ollama Client** (20.9% vs 85.6%)
   - Critical API client with major coverage loss
   - May indicate structural changes

2. **Models Package** (52.1% vs 91.8%)
   - Model compatibility system affected
   - Previously excellent coverage

3. **LangChain Integration** (14.6% vs 45.9%)
   - Core integration functionality
   - Substantial testing gap

## 🛠️ Recovery Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization
1. **Identify Missing Tests**
   - Run test discovery to find removed/disabled tests
   - Check for test file relocations or renames

2. **Restore Critical Functionality Tests**
   - Focus on 0% coverage packages first
   - Prioritize core functionality (MCP, testing, vectorstore)

3. **Validate Test Infrastructure**
   - Ensure test discovery is working correctly
   - Check for build configuration changes

### Phase 2: Coverage Recovery
1. **Systematic Package Recovery**
   - Work through packages in priority order
   - Restore tests for critical functionality first

2. **New Code Testing**
   - Identify and test new functionality added in Maine updates
   - Ensure new features have appropriate test coverage

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify that package interactions still work correctly
   - Add integration tests for new functionality

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today)
   - ✅ Fix failing planner test (COMPLETED)
   - Investigate MCP and testing package coverage loss
   - Run diagnostic commands to understand test discovery issues

2. **Short Term** (This Week)
   - Restore critical package test coverage
   - Update documentation to reflect Maine changes
   - Establish new coverage baseline

3. **Medium Term** (Next Sprint)
   - Implement comprehensive test recovery plan
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update testing strategy based on new architecture

## 🏆 Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal**: All tests passing (✅ ACHIEVED)
- **Coverage Target**: Restore critical packages to >60% coverage
- **Quality Gate**: No package should have 0% coverage
- **Documentation**: All changes properly documented
