## üîß Testing Infrastructure

### Test Organization
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/*/[component]_test.go     # Unit tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/[feature]_test.go # Integration tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/testutil/mocks/          # Mock objects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/testutil/fixtures/       # Test data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/cleanup-tests.sh     # Maintenance scripts
```

### Testing Frameworks
- **Standard Library**: Core `testing` package
- **Testify**: Assertions and mocking (`github.com/stretchr/testify`)
- **Ginkgo/Gomega**: BDD-style testing for complex scenarios
- **Custom Mocks**: Hand-crafted mocks for specific integrations

### Quality Assurance
- All tests must pass before code acceptance
- Race condition detection with `go test -race`
- Coverage tracking and reporting
- Automated cleanup and organization

## üöÄ Strategic Priorities

### High Priority (Next Sprint)

   - Command-line argument parsing
   - Integration point mocking

2. **TUI Components** (`pkg/tui` - 0.8%)
   - Component rendering and interaction
   - Theme application and color management
   - Keyboard navigation testing

3. **Controller Expansion** (`pkg/controllers` - 25.5%)
   - LangChain controller comprehensive testing
   - Orchestrator controller coverage
   - Error handling and edge cases

### Medium Priority (Next Month)
1. **Agent System** (`pkg/agents` - 56.8%)
   - Push toward 60%+ coverage
   - Integration testing between agents
   - Error handling and recovery scenarios

2. **Configuration System** (`pkg/config` - 21.8%)
   - Complex configuration merging
   - Environment variable handling
   - File locking edge cases

3. **Chat System** (`pkg/chat` - 51.2%)
   - Memory management comprehensive testing
   - Streaming functionality validation
   - Conversation persistence testing

### Long-term (Next Quarter)
1. **Integration Testing Strategy**
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Performance and load testing
   - Cross-component integration

2. **Quality Automation**

   - Automated coverage reporting
   - Performance regression detection

## üìà Quality Metrics

### Test Execution Performance
- **Total Test Time**: ~60-70 seconds for full suite
- **Unit Tests**: Fast execution (< 100ms per test)
- **Integration Tests**: Moderate execution (with external dependencies)
- **Race Detection**: Clean - no race conditions detected

### Coverage Distribution
- **Packages ‚â•60%**: 6 out of 17 (35%)
- **Packages ‚â•40%**: 9 out of 17 (53%)
- **Packages <20%**: 4 out of 17 (24%)

### Code Quality Indicators
