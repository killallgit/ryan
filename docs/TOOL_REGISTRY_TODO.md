# Tool System Implementation Status & Roadmap

**NOTICE**: This document has been superseded by [TOOL_PARITY_PLAN.md](TOOL_PARITY_PLAN.md) which contains the comprehensive Claude Code parity implementation plan.

## Current Status Summary

### üéâ Phase 1-2: Foundation & Integration - COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ Foundation Complete (Phase 1-2)
- [x] Universal Tool interface with JSON Schema support
- [x] Basic provider format adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- [x] Tool registry system with thread-safe access
- [x] Two built-in tools (BashTool, FileReadTool) with security constraints
- [x] Full Ollama integration with chat controller
- [x] TUI integration with event-driven tool execution
- [x] Streaming infrastructure complete

## üöß Phase 3: Claude Code Parity - IN PROGRESS

**Goal**: Achieve feature parity with Claude Code's sophisticated tool execution system.

### Current Gap Analysis
**Ryan's Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Basic tool registry with 2 tools
- ‚úÖ Single tool execution
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking TUI integration
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Batch execution, concurrent orchestration, comprehensive tool suite

**Claude Code Capabilities Identified**:
- "Multiple tools in single response" - Batch execution architecture
- Concurrent orchestration with result aggregation
- 15+ production-ready tools with advanced features
- Provider-agnostic universal interface

### Phase 3A: Advanced Execution Engine (Weeks 1-2) - CURRENT
**Target**: Build concurrent tool orchestration matching Claude Code patterns

**Key Components**:
- Goroutine pool manager for concurrent execution
- Result aggregator with batch processing
- Progress manager for real-time feedback
- Context management with cancellation support

### Phase 3B: Comprehensive Tool Suite (Weeks 3-4) - PLANNED
**Target**: Expand from 2 to 15+ production-ready tools

**Tools to Implement**:
- WebFetch (HTTP with caching, rate limiting)
- Enhanced Grep (ripgrep integration, syntax highlighting)
- Glob (advanced pattern matching)
- Enhanced Read/Write (encoding detection, PDF support)
- Directory operations (LS, mkdir, tree view)
- Git integration (status, commit, diff)
- Process management
- Network tools

### Phase 3C: Multi-Provider Integration (Weeks 5-6) - PLANNED
**Target**: Universal tool calling for OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama

**Architecture**:
- Provider abstraction layer
- Tool definition format conversion
- Streaming tool execution integration
- Real-time progress display in TUI

### Phase 4: Production Features (Future)
- Tool execution sandboxing and resource limits
- User consent system for dangerous operations  
- Audit logging and execution tracking
- Tool execution history and replay capabilities

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Future)
- MCP protocol support and JSON-RPC transport
- Advanced UI features (syntax highlighting, themes)
- Performance optimization and caching strategies
- Custom tool development and plugin system

## Detailed Implementation Plan

üìã **[CLAUDE_CODE_ANALYSIS.md](CLAUDE_CODE_ANALYSIS.md)** - Detailed analysis of Claude Code's tool capabilities

üìã **[TOOL_SYSTEM.md](TOOL_SYSTEM.md)** - Updated system architecture with parity goals

## Legacy Implementation Summary

### Historical Phases 1-2: Foundation & Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**What Was Accomplished**:
- Universal Tool interface with JSON Schema support
- Provider format adapters for multiple LLM providers
- Two built-in tools (execute_bash, read_file) with security constraints
- Full Ollama integration with chat controller and TUI
- Thread-safe tool execution with event-driven architecture
- Streaming infrastructure and non-blocking UI integration

**Files Modified**: `pkg/chat/client.go`, `pkg/chat/messages.go`, `pkg/controllers/chat.go`, `cmd/root.go`, `pkg/tui/events.go`

**Built-in Tools Available**:
1. **execute_bash** - Safe shell command execution with path restrictions
2. **read_file** - File content reading with extension and size limits

**Status**: üéâ **PHASES 1-2 COMPLETE** - Foundation solid for Claude Code parity work
