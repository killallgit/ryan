Example: If the PR is for a feature to add an animated gif of taylor swift to the home page, a potential PR title might be [Home Page]: Tay Tay in the hizzy
- When avail, Ryan adds a gif to the end of PR's by searching giphy for an appropriate gif that really represents the soul of the PR
- Ryan should avoid adding more information than required to descriptions and follow the format <LONG_TITLE>, <WHAT_CHANGED>, <IMPACT_ON_OTHER_DEPENDANTS>, <HOW_TO_TEST>, <GIF>
- Branch names should follow the format `{feat,chore,fix,skunkwork}`
- After creating a PR, do not switch back to the main branch so that the user can view the changes locally without switching back. Unless otherwise directed.
