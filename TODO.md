- refactor the chat update method into multiple files so that it's easier to review. Create a separate dimensions.go file with the code related to figuring and setting terminal dimensions.
- in key_msg when the event to start the stream is sent, we will not know exactly which agent we're going to get a response from. In the future this will be dynamically figured out. We need to come up with a better way of handling that
- make sure spinner is using theme colors
- make sure spinner is part of the status row above input text area. This pkg is "status" and will follow the same pattern as the other tui models where each interface func has its own file
- In the future we need to get the terminal width dynamically using the term library
- logging needs a better abstraction. For the debug log when the app starts we need to get the directory that viper is using for its config location as the base.
