- Tool usage. Scaffold out the core tools: Bash(), WebSearch(), List(), Search(), Find(), Read(), ReadMany(), Write(). Each of these tools needs to be in their own package: pkg/toole/{bash,list,read_many,etc}. For now we just need to scaffold out the common interface by following the langchain documentation around tool usage: https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#tools since these docs dont exist on the golang official docs you would need to reference the pkg.go.dev pages.
