# Style updates
- put inner padding on the chat area
- Change the ctrl-p menu into a very simple list that can select using the j/k keys and pressing <enter> opens the view. remove the descriptions and just have the title as the list item. This modal should also have a little inner padding
- Pressing <esc> on any of the views takes you back to the last view that was selected
- All views should have a little padding as well as follow the same color scheme as the model management view
- The chat input field should have a dim orange solid line with rounded corners around it as well as the > (prompt) on the inside of the input area
- Remove the help text from the footer and "Model:" from the selected model display. The selected model text should be justified to the right
- The non-chat view views' help text in the footer should always be center aligned
- Create a new branch and a PR for these changes
