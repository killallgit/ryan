- Streaming text doesn't seem to work. Either we're not getting it in streaming form or the events are not registering a change. I expect to see the <think><MESSAGE_STREAM...></think> which i know is somehow avail to get access to through langchain.
- chat_history.json should be saved no matter what type of log level is enabled. This is a good opportunity to setup our contextmanager.
- status bar tokens are not displayed. We need to think about how to access these from langchain
- system.log is not using the path set in the settings file -> logging.log_file
