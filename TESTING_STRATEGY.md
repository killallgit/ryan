# Comprehensive Testing Strategy for Ryan

## Executive Summary

Ryan is a complex TUI-based chat application with LLM integration, requiring comprehensive testing across multiple layers. Test coverage has improved with recent updates - agents now at 24.9% (up from 0%), though MCP (0%) and TUI (0%) remain untested.

## Current Coverage Analysis

### Critical Gaps (0% Coverage)

- **pkg/testing**: Test compatibility checker untested

### Low Coverage (<30%)
- **cmd**: 6.0% - Main entry points poorly tested
- **pkg/config**: 12.0% - Configuration management significantly expanded with comprehensive tests
- **pkg/langchain**: 14.6% - LangChain integration needs more coverage
- **pkg/controllers**: 22.9% - Controller logic needs expansion

### High Coverage (80%+)
- **pkg/ollama**: 85.6% - API client comprehensively tested (up from 20.9%)

### Moderate Coverage (30-60%)
- **pkg/chat**: 42.2% - Conversation management partially tested
- **pkg/agents**: 44.6% - Agent orchestration significantly improved (was 0%)
- **pkg/vectorstore**: 46.5% - Vector storage partially covered
- **pkg/models**: 52.1% - Model compatibility reasonably tested

### Good Coverage (>60%)
- **pkg/logger**: 63.6% - Logging well tested
- **pkg/tools**: 60.0% - Tool implementations reasonably covered
- **pkg/testutil**: 89.7% - Test utilities well covered
